## About the game (features / technologies) 

The Bacteria Adventure is a maze based game and its main purpose is to teach a bit about microbiology in a funny way. It is mainly designed for kids in school, but adults can play and have fun either! I am an undergraduate Biomedical Informatics student and I got the idea for this game while trying to explain some basic concepts of microbiology to my 12-year-old brother, who was not able to catch my explanation at all. I realised that a game could explain it much better than my words and some colorless drawings in the notebook. The game has 3 levels and the main character is a bacteria. As you pass the levels the difficulty is raised and some microbiology elements show up, having an important role in the game. That's how I planned to make it fun, interactive and full of important microbiology elements.

For building this Swift Playground game I used basically the SpriteKit framework, which is really cool because I was able to get the concepts and build a nice game in less than a week. Iâ€™ve chosen the iPad as the game target device because it is awesome to play it by tapping on the screen and kids get way more engaged playing on an iPad than in a Mac with the cursor.

My brother and his friends loved this playground game and hopefully they will like microbiology as much as I do. I Hope you love it too!

## P.S.
The game was made for iPad, so it only works on iPads.
